Supplimentary developer tool. PortableCSSPad adds a tiny pad you can use to
apply CSS changes to a webpage immediately.

Currently designed as a user script for usage on wikia.com wikis
Still alpha, not intended for distribution/usage yet

However, code is not really bound to wikia.com's DOM, so this
*could* presumably be used on any website I think.

----

Type "pp" to open the pad again if you close it

Target browsers: Chrome/Firefox

More info to come later hopefully
